# Joseph Wright's Portfolio

My portfolio is meant to give a prospective client a sense of who I am, what I can do and whether I am the person they should hire to execute their project. In this project I examine situations in which I was able to solve business problems, overcome creative challenges or generate positive results despite limited resources.
