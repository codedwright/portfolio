# Joseph Wright's Portfolio

**Goals:** Examine situations in which I was able to solve business problems, overcome creative challenges or generate positive results despite limited resources. Included in this portfolio: experiences relevant to the prospective employerâ€™s needs, how these projects solved business objectives, how the results from the work were measured, any quantifiable data able to be shared, and any aspects that make it especially memorable or interesting.
